# Discrete Optimisation

This course is about creating optimised solutions for challenging optimisation problems.  Various medhods can be used to this effect.  
The course is described on [Coursera - Discrete Optimisation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization/supplement/m0x9h/course-syllabus).

## Methodologies

* Constraint Programming (CP)
* Local Search (LS)
* Linear Programming (LP)
* Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)
